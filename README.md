# Amanda Perez — Data Engineer & AI/ML Creator  

🚀 **Software Developer | Data Engineer | AI/ML Creator | ROG Zephyrus G16 Power User**  

I build and operate systems that turn **raw data into signal**. From personal health + Spotify pipelines to enterprise-grade AI/ML dashboards, I design, engineer, and ship solutions that merge **creativity, engineering, and performance**.  

### 🔧 Technical Focus  
- **Python + Data Science** → Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, ETL pipelines  
- **AI/ML** → anomaly detection, trend analysis, applied ML workflows  
- **Full-Stack Apps** → Flask/FastAPI, React, and scalable dashboards  
- **Visualization** → interactive dashboards for insights and decision-making  

### 🎮 Powered by ROG  
I run all of my development, engineering, and creative projects on an **ASUS ROG Zephyrus G16 (NVIDIA GPU)**.  
ROG hardware isn’t just for gaming—it powers real AI/ML workloads, data pipelines, and next-gen applications.  

### 📂 Featured Projects  
- **apSystems** → My solutions shop repo, documenting end-to-end software + AI pipelines.  
- **Iron Matrix** → A full-stack workout logger + performance dashboard app (in progress).  
- **Anomaly Detection Demos** → Applied data science with visualization and AI/ML techniques.  

### 🌍 Creator Perspective  
I bridge **engineering, gaming culture, and performance systems**. Raised on Halo tournaments with my brothers, I now channel that same competitive edge into building high-performance data systems.
